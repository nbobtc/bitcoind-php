nbobtc/bitcoind-php
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbobtc/bitcoind-php.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbobtc/bitcoind-php)

This project is a wrapper for a bitcoind daemon. This project is still
being worked on and the interface may change a little until I get something
more stable.

# Installation

You can install this library by using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/). You
can also view more info about this on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/nbobtc/bitcoind-php).

Add this to the `requires` in your `composer.json` file.

# Usage

To use the project you need to just create a new instance of the class.

    <?php

    use Nbobtc\Bitcoind\Bitcoind;
    use Nbobtc\Bitcoind\Client;

    $bitcoind = new Bitcoind(new Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332'));

You can view the [BitcoindInterface](https://github.com/nbobtc/bitcoind-php/blob/master/src/Nbobtc/Bitcoind/BitcoindInterface.php)
file for a list of methods and descriptions of what they are and how to use them.

# Tests

To run the tests you need to install the development packages using composer
