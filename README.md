This project is used to interact with a headless bitcoin program called
bitcoind. It also contains various utility classes for working with Bitcoin as a
PHP Developer.

## Installation

You can install this library by using [Composer]. 
You can also get more information about this on [Packagist].

```bash
composer require nbobtc/bitcoind-php
```

## Usage

To use the project you need to just create a new instance of the class.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$command = new \Nbobtc\Command\Command('getinfo');
$client  = new \Nbobtc\Http\Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332');

/** @var \Nbobtc\Http\Message\Response */
$response = $client->sendCommand($command);

/** @var string */
$contents = $response->getBody()->getContents();
echo $contents;


```

You are able to get the [Request] and [Response] objects back from
the client with the correct getters: `getRequest()` and `getResponse()`.

You can also parse the response however you wish to do so since the result is
returned to you as a string. See below for some ideas!

## Commands

Commands are created in such a way that this will support any future updates the
[Bitcoin API] by providing you with an easy class that sets all the required
information.

You are able to pass into the object the `method` and the `parameters` that are
required. Here are a few examples:

```php
// No Parameters
$command = new Command('getinfo');

// One Parameter
$command = new Command('getblock', '000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f');

// Multiple Parameters
$command = new Command('sendfrom', array('fromaccount', 'tobitcoinaddress', 'amount'));
```

The second argument MUST be in the same order as on the [Bitcoin API] wiki page.
There is no need to assign the values any keys.

### Parameters

Parameters are the second argument when creating a new Command. This argument
can either be a string OR an array. For example, both of these are valid.

```php
$command = new Command('getblock', array('000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f'));
$command = new Command('getblock', '000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f');
```

Most commands in the [Bitcoin API] take one parameter. If it takes MORE than
one, you must pass the parameters in as an array in the ORDER you find them on
that page.

### Extending Commands

If, for any reason, you need to extend a command, it MUST implement
[CommandInterface]. You can find documentation within the interface on how to
implement this.

## Drivers

Drivers are used by the ClientInterface for connecting to a bitcoind service and
sending Requests. The return a Response. If you need to implement a new driver
take a look at the [DriverInterface].

### cURL Driver

This is used by default and allows you a lot of options for customizing it to
your needs.

You can set various [cURL Options] by passing them into the function
`addCurlOption($option, $value)`.

Here's an example of how to configure and use the driver.

```php
$driver = new \Nbobtc\Http\Driver\CurlDriver();
$driver
    ->addCurlOption(CURLOPT_VERBOSE, true)
    ->addCurlOption(CURLOPT_STDERR, '/var/logs/curl.err');

$client = new \Nbobtc\Http\Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332');
$client->withDriver($driver);
```

Feel free to take a look at the `CurlDriver` source code.

## Cookbook

### How to enable a Keep-Alive ie Persistent Connection

This example shows how you are able to set the client up to [Persistent
Connection].

```php
$client = new \Nbobtc\Http\Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332');
$client->getRequest()->withHeader('Connection', 'Keep-Alive');
```

### How to set a CA Cert

This library provides some wonderful flexibility that will allow you to
configure the client to use your own CA Cert.

```php
$driver = new \Nbobtc\Http\Driver\CurlDriver();
$driver->addCurlOption(CURLOPT_CAINFO, '/path/to/cert');

$client = new \Nbobtc\Http\Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332');
$client->withDriver($driver);
```

### How to Convert Output to an Array

Some like the arrays

```php
$response = $client->sendCommand($command);
$output   = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
```

### How to Convert Output to a stdClass object

Some like the objects

```php
$response = $client->sendCommand($command);
$output   = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents());
```

## Testing

All testing is done using PHPUnit. You should be able to run `phpunit` in the
root directory of this project (the directory where phpunit.xml.dist is located)
and the tests will run.

If submitting a pull request or working on this library, please make sure that
the tests will pass.
